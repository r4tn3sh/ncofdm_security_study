# NCOFDM security study

This GNU Octave project highlights the insights obtained in our paper "Physical-layer security of NC-OFDM-based systems". The goal of the project is to highlight the features of Cyclic Autocorrelation Function (CAF) for OFDM signal and to study the changes in CAF features due to a NC-OFDM transmission.
